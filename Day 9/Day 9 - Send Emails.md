# Day 9 - Send Emails and Read Inbox

For this day I combined lessons 7-9 from Coding for Entrepreneurs' 30 days of Python course. In these lessons, I created a function to format a message that I could import as an internal module into other script, from there I created three additional scripts.
- send - that sends messages to a list of to emails
- send_mail - creates the server to send emails
- inbox - allows you to read your inbox for unseen messages

Together these scripts allow you to send messages to a less secured gmail account and read messages from that same account.
