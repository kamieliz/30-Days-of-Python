## String Basics

Strings in Python are ordered sequences of zero or more characters

we can use them to represent arbitrary collections of symbols.

This might be words, whole sentences, or random strings of letters, numerals, and punctuation.

Strings are sometimes called "string literals"

In order to create a string, we just need to wrap some series of characters in quotation marks

We can use single or double quotes.

They don’t have any different meaning in Python

there’s no strong reason you should exclusively use one or the other

We can’t, however, start a string with one type of quote and end the string with a different type. This is invalid syntax

Printing strings works just like it does for numbers. We can just pass in a string when calling the `print` function

a string containing a single space, and spaces are characters, so the string is **not** empty

## Variables

we can name values in Python using an *assignment operation*. The syntax for binding a value to a name is relatively simple. We just need to write the name we want to use, an `=` symbol, and the some expression. The result of the expression—the value it evaluates to—is what the name refers to. This name is called a variable

The variable names we choose are entirely up to us, but there are a few rules we need to keep in mind:

- Variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscore (`_`) characters.
- Variable names can’t start with a number, though starting with an underscore is allowed.
- Variable names are case sensitive, but can be in any case.
